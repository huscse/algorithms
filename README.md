# My Algorithms (Pseudocode)

This repo is where I’m keeping all the algorithms I practice, written in **pseudocode**.
It’s just for my own learning and reference.

## What’s inside

- Sorting (Insertion, Merge, Quick, etc.)
- Searching (Linear, Binary, etc.)
- Graph stuff (BFS, DFS)
- Other algorithms I learn along the way

## Why pseudocode?

Because it’s easier to focus on the **logic** first without worrying about language syntax.
